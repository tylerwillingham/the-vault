# The Vault
The Vault is a Ruby on Rails powered, JSON-serving, application for managing basic employee benefits and inquiries such as time-off requests.

This is a pet project. Hopefully it will grow, but don't expect immediate support. Feel free to fork this an run with it, or feel free to tear it to pieces and let me know how I can get better.
